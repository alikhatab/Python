# I made a list here to check which number is odd or even
my_list =[10, 27, 36, 48, 55, 56, 77, 88, 99, 110, 1.5, 1.4]

# Alway when you have a list think about loop
for Tal in my_list:

# When you want to sort in a list you have to use if, even
 if (Tal % 2 ==0):
     print(str(Tal), "talet var jämt")
     
# when you want to make another statement use elif, odd 
 elif (Tal % 2 !=0): 
    print(Tal, "ojämt tal")

# in this program there is
# 1. list
# 2. loop
# 3. if, elif
# 4. Modulo Operator
